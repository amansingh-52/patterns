## 1. DuckODuck - Strategy Pattern  

### Overview  
The **Strategy Pattern** defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It allows the algorithm to vary independently from the client that uses it.

### When to Use  
- You have multiple algorithms for a specific task.  
- You want to allow dynamic selection of algorithms at runtime.  
- You aim to separate concerns by decoupling behavior from implementation.  

### How It Works  
- The behavior (algorithm) is extracted into separate strategy classes.  
- A context class maintains a reference to a strategy object.  
- The client can switch strategies dynamically at runtime.  

### Example Usage  
Imagine a duck simulation game where different ducks can have different flying and quacking behaviors. Instead of hardcoding behaviors, the Strategy Pattern allows assigning behaviors dynamically.  


```mermaid
graph TD;

    Duck["Duck (Base Class)"];
    FlyBehaviour["FlyBehaviour (Interface)"];
    QuackBehaviour["QuackBehaviour (Interface)"];

    MallardDuck["MallardDuck"];
    ModelDuck["ModelDuck"];

    FlyWithWings["FlyWithWings"];
    FlyNoFly["FlyNoFly"];
    FlyRocketPowered["FlyRocketPowered"];

    Quack["Quack"];
    MuteQuack["MuteQuack"];
    Squeak["Squeak"];

    MallardDuck -->|inherits| Duck;
    ModelDuck -->|inherits| Duck;

    Duck --|has-a|--> FlyBehaviour;
    Duck --|has-a|--> QuackBehaviour;

    FlyWithWings -.->|implements| FlyBehaviour;
    FlyNoFly -.->|implements| FlyBehaviour;
    FlyRocketPowered -.->|implements| FlyBehaviour;

    Quack -.->|implements| QuackBehaviour;
    MuteQuack -.->|implements| QuackBehaviour;
    Squeak -.->|implements| QuackBehaviour;

```
